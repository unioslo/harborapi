        List of repositories to fetch artifacts from.
        Can be either the full name or only the repository name:

    query : Optional[str]
        The query to filter the artifacts by.
        Follows the same format as the Harbor API.
        Has no effect if `tag` is specified.
    callback : Optional[Callable[[List[Exception]], None]]
        A callback function to handle exceptions raised by the API calls.
