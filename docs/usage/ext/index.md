# `ext`: Extended functionality

The `harborapi.ext` module contains extensions and utility functions that are not part of the Harbor API.

It expands the functionality of the Harbor API by providing additional
functionality for common task such as fetching all artifacts and their
vulnerabilities in one or more repositories or projects. See: [`harborapi.ext.api`](../../reference/ext/api.md)

Furthermore, it contains models for combining multiple Harbor API models and aggregating their data. See: [Artifact Info](./artifact.md) and [Report](./report.md)
