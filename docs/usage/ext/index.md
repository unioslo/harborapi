# `ext`: Extended functionality

The `harborapi.ext` module contains extensions and utility functions that are not part of the Harbor API.

It expands the functionality of the Harbor API by providing additional
functionality for common task such as fetching all artifacts and their
vulnerabilities in one or more repositories or projects. See: [`harborapi.ext.api`](../../reference/ext/api.md)

Furthermore, it contains models for combining multiple Harbor API models and aggregating their data. See: [Artifact Info](./artifact.md) and [Report](./report.md)

The `harborapi.ext` module is not part of the Harbor API specification and is not guaranteed to be stable. It may change in future versions of `harborapi`.

Importing `harborapi.ext` is optional and does not require any additional dependencies.

```py
import harborapi.ext
# or
from harborapi import ext
# or
from harborapi.ext import api, artifact, cve, report
# or
from harborapi.ext.api import get_artifact_info, get_artifact_vulnerabilities #, ...
```

Your IDE should provide auto-completion for the various imports available from the `harborapi.ext` module. Otherwise, check the [Reference](/reference)
