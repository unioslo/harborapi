## Fetch a single resource

When fetching a single resource, the method usually expects a resource identifier or name as the first parameter, and returns a single instance of the Pydantic model corresponding to the resource type.

Each method's return type is documented in the [Endpoints Overview](../../endpoints/index.md)


```py
import asyncio
from harborapi import HarborAsyncClient

client = HarborAsyncClient(...)

async def main() -> None:
    project = await client.get_project("test-project")
    print(project)


asyncio.run(main())
```

In this case we pass in a project name to [`get_project`][harborapi.HarborAsyncClient.get_project] and receive a [`Project`][harborapi.models.Project] object.


## Fetch multiple resources

Certain methods fetch multiple resources and return a list of Pydantic models. Below is a basic example of how to use these methods.

```py
import asyncio
from harborapi import HarborAsyncClient

client = HarborAsyncClient(...)


async def main() -> None:
    projects = await client.get_projects()
    for project in projects:
        print(project)


asyncio.run(main())
```

In this case we call [`get_projects`][harborapi.HarborAsyncClient.get_projects] with no arguments, and receive a list of [`Project`][harborapi.models.Project] objects.

Methods that fetch multiple resources have a number of optional arguments that can be passed in to filter, sort and limit the results. These arguments are documented below.


### `query`

A query string to filter the results by.

#### Syntax

`field1[operator][value],[field2[operator][value]],...`

#### Query patterns

* exact match(`"k=v"`)
* fuzzy match(`"k=~v"`)
* range(`"k=[min~max]"`)
* list with union releationship(`"k={v1 v2 v3}"`)
* list with intersection relationship(`"k=(v1 v2 v3)"`).


#### Value types

* string(enclosed by `"` or `'`)
* integer
* time(in format `"2020-04-09 02:36:00"`)


**Example**


Fetch all projects with a name containing `test`, owned by the user `admin`, and created between 2020-01-01 and 2023-12-31

```py
await client.get_projects(
    query="name=~test,owner=admin,created_at=[2020-01-01~2023-12-31]",
)
```

!!! warning
    The field we query for owner name is called `owner` despite the field on the [`Project`][harborapi.models.Project] model being called `owner_name`. This is one of many examples of divergences in the API spec that we have no control over.

    As you work with the API, it is likely you will encounter more of these inconsistencies.


To get an idea of the fields you can query, call [`get_model_fields()`][harborapi.models.base.BaseModel.get_model_fields] on the model the method returns. This will return a set of field names that you can use in your query. As the warning above states, the actual field names the API expects might be subtly different than the field names on the actual model, but the list should give you a good idea of what is available:

```py
from harborapi.models import Project

print(Project.get_model_fields())
# or
print(Project().get_model_fields())
```

```py title="Result"
{'project_id', 'owner_id', 'name', 'registry_id', 'creation_time', 'update_time', 'deleted', 'owner_name', 'togglable', 'current_user_role_id', 'current_user_role_ids', 'repo_count', 'metadata', 'cve_allowlist'}
```

The method can be called on both the class itself or an instance of the class.

----

### `sort`

The field(s) to sort the results by. Must match the field names of the API response model.

#### Syntax

`field1,field2,...`

Prepend fields with `-` to sort in descending order.

**Example**

```py
await client.get_projects(
    sort="name,-created_at",
)
```

!!! warning

    Not all fields support sorting. This is not documented anywhere by Harbor, and the only way to know which fields work is to try them out. Unsortable/unknown field names are ignored by the API. The same naming logic for field names apply to `sort` as they do to `query`. Some field names diverge from the names in the spec when used in this manner. See [query](#query) for more information.

----

### `limit`

The maximum number of results to return. By default unlimited (`None`).

For certain methods, such as [`HarborAsyncClient.get_audit_logs()`][harborapi.HarborAsyncClient.get_audit_logs], it is highly advised to set a limit to avoid fetching every single entry in the database.

**Example**

```py
await client.get_projects(
    limit=10,
)
```

----

### `page`

The page number to start fetching from. This is a parameter that is used in conjunction with `page_size` to control how results are fetched from the API. In the vast majority of cases, this specific parameter does not need to be changed.

**Example**

```py
await client.get_projects(
    page=2,
)
```

----

### `page_size`

The number of results to return per page. This is a parameter that is used in conjunction with `page` to control how results are fetched from the API. Used in situtations where you want to either reduce or increase the number of requests to the API, and conversely the size of each response. (Higher page size = fewer requests, but larger responses).

As with `page`, this specific parameter does not need to be changed in the vast majority of cases.

**Example**

```py
await client.get_projects(
    page_size=20,
)
```

### Example (with all parameters)


We can use all of the above parameters together to fetch a specific set of resources. In this case, we want to fetch all projects that have a name containing `test`, and were created between 2020-01-01 and 2023-12-31. We want to sort the results by name, and limit the results to 100 projects.

```py
import asyncio
from harborapi import HarborAsyncClient

client = HarborAsyncClient(...)


async def main() -> None:
    projects = await client.get_projects(
        query="name=~test,created_at=[2020-01-01~2023-12-31]",
        sort="name",
        page=1,
        page_size=10,
        limit=100,
    )
    for project in projects:
        print(project)


asyncio.run(main())
```
