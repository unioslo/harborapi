# `harborapi.ext`

This module provides additional functionality for common tasks such as concurrency and aggregation of multiple API calls. The recipes in this section make use of this module.

Everyting the `harborapi.ext` module provides is also available in the `harborapi` module. For example, [harborapi.ext.api.get_repositories][] is also available as [harborapi.HarborAsyncClient.get_repositories][], but without concurrency.
