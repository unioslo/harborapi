"""Tests for models modules with a leading underscore in their name.

In previous versions of harborapi, models were defined in modules with a leading
underscore in their name, and then fixes were applied in models with the same
name without the leading underscore. In order to maintain backwards compatibility,
the underscore modules are still present, but they are deprecated and will be removed
in a future version.
